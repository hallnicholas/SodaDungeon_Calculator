# SodaDungeon_Calculator


This is a simple program. Input your current levels:

Relic of Attack

Relic of Magic Boost

Relic of [Character]


Then input how much essence you have. The program will 
tell you how to optimize your essence spending if all 
you care about is damage dealt.

Preference for Relic of Health & heavier weight to 
    Relic of [Darkmage] with ratio for how much you
    care about survivability
